# Gender-prediction-using-Naive-Bayes
Bayes' Theorem-Based Gender Prediction Model

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a Bayesian inference model to predict gender based on names. Using Bayes' theorem, the model classifies names into gender categories by leveraging probability distributions from a dataset.

ðŸš€ Features

Probabilistic Approach: Uses Bayes' theorem for classification.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares name-based datasets.

Optimization: Fine-tuned probability distributions for improved accuracy.

Efficiency: Implemented in Jupyter Notebook with optimized computation.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“Š How It Works

Loads a dataset of names with associated genders.

Computes prior and likelihood probabilities.

Applies Bayes' theorem to predict the gender of new names.

Evaluates performance and adjusts parameters for accuracy.
